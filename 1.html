                    <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been involved in conversations with a few Go developers who have
expressed frustration about Go&rsquo;s interfaces with respect to nil. It seems not
everyone understands that interfaces are a reference type (like a pointer), and
they can reference other reference types (i.e., pointers, maps, slices, etc).
Because all reference types have a nil (zero) value, an interface can be nil
or an interface can reference a nil pointer; people may fail to realize that
the nility of the interface is independent from the nility of the thing it
points to, and when we ask (for example) <code>if err != nil</code>, we&rsquo;re actually asking
<em>is the interface nil?</em>, not <em>is the value behind the interface nil?</em>. Here are
a few examples that will (<em>hopefully</em>) demonstrate this clearly:</p>

                    <p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m curious about the performance of different languages. At work, I
usually write Python, but I often find tasks that are inherently parallelizable
and could thus benefit from parallel execution. Unfortunately, Python is
notoriously difficult to parallelize<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:posts/benchmarking-go-and-python.htmla"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:posts/benchmarking-go-and-python.htmla">1</a></sup>. In one case, we needed to validate
that a table of values of a particular type could be convertible into a values
of a different type based on some known set of conversion rules. Since Go is a
great language for writing concurrent programs (and executing them in
parallel), I decided to compare a sequential Python implementation to
sequential and parallel Go implementations.</p>

find it too difficult to figure out the equivalent commands for their platform.
I&rsquo;m not assuming much prior knowledge, but readers should at least be
comfortable navigating around a Unix terminal, and any familiarity with
environment variables is helpful (a quick Google search for &ldquo;environment
variables&rdquo; should suffice). Without further ado:</p>

best-practices. I intend to add to it over time, so don&rsquo;t be surprised if it
changes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve known about this blog post for a couple years, and I find myself frequently
referring people to it. It&rsquo;s written by a Google engineer who does a much better
job of articulating good architecture techniques than I could. A must-read for
any software developer: <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/08/by-miko-hevery-so-you-decided-to.html">Writing Testable Code by Misko Hevery</a></p>

<p>This next post is something I just came across, but it does a really good job
explaining why writing testable code is not just about validating your code&rsquo;s
functionality. Because it&rsquo;s something I run into a lot in dynamic languages like
Python or Qt/C++, I would also add that hacky workarounds (like Python&rsquo;s
<code>unittest.mock.patch()</code>) exist that let you technically validate your code
without actually writing what is considered to be well-designed, testable code.
