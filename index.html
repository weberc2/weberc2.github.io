                    <p>There&rsquo;s an ongoing debate among infrastructure-as-code practitioners between
configuration languages like YAML and HCL and using &ldquo;real programming
languages&rdquo; (including domain specific programming languages) to generate
configuration. The debate is going very poorly because there is a lot
of confusion about the &ldquo;real programming languages&rdquo; position, so I want to
correct some of the common points of confusion (&ldquo;myths&rdquo;) so the conversation
can focus on more substantial concerns.</p>

                    <p>Another year, another blog update. BitBucket is deprecating their Mercurial
support, and while I really do appreciate Mercurial, it&rsquo;s just easier for me to
keep everything in GitHub than trying to find another Mercurial provider. Also,
GitHub seems to be improving at a pretty rapid pace. So voila, this blog is now
hosted on GitHub. This includes my pet static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/weberc2/neon"><code>neon</code></a> which
is used to generate this site.</p>

<p>Further, my pet build tool <a href="https://github.com/weberc2/builder"><code>builder</code></a> is sufficiently far along that I
can use it to automate the building of this static site. <code>builder</code> is pretty
cool so far. At some point I will write a dedicated post about it.</p>

been a high priority, since I only post a couple of times a year, but it&rsquo;s
always bothered me that something that is such an ideal candidate for
automation hasn&rsquo;t been automated. Anyway, I finally did it and I want to
describe the setup in case it&rsquo;s helpful for anyone looking to do the same.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: If you&rsquo;re here for the TL;DR, skip to the bottom.</p>

<p>A few months ago I built out some monitoring infrastructure at work using Go. I
deployed it to ECS (a Docker orchestrator, functionally similar to Kubernetes),
and for fun I decided to see how minimal I could make the image. I&rsquo;ve used
Alpine base images before (which weigh in at about 5 MB and usually another 5 MB
for a small Go binary), but being that Go advertises itself as requiring only a
Linux kernel (most programming languages depend on an interpreter, a VM, and/or
system libraries&ndash;the latter abstract over kernel functionality and sometimes
provide a stable interface to the kernel), I wanted to see how true or practical
this was, and I wanted to better understand the things that I was taking for
granted by using distros.</p>

<p>As a matter of context, Docker has a special base image called <code>scratch</code> which
is empty&ndash;an application running on a scratch base image only has access to the
kernel (at least to the extent that containers provide isolation).</p>

                    <p>A little over 2.5 years ago, I wrote a tutorial about <a href="./installing-go-on-linux-and-osx.html">installing Go</a>. Since
then, one of the more significant changes to the Go ecosystem has been the
addition of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules">modules</a>, which effectively does away with the hardest part of
installing Go&ndash;<code>$GOPATH</code>. This change occurred in the latest version: Go 1.11.</p>

<p>In addition to installing Go, I wanted to make a guide that can get you from
nothing to a real project in half an hour. Most languages focus their
introductory material on the language and briefly cover setting up a toy
program. When you&rsquo;re done, you realize you have no idea how to build a
multi-file program, how to add dependencies (or at least how to add them in a
way that won&rsquo;t break other things on your system), how to get an editor up
and running, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to focus much at all on Go the language here, since it&rsquo;s super
easy to learn and there are already many great tutorials (the official
<a href="https://tour.golang.org">Tour</a> is probably not a bad place to start). I&rsquo;m only going to go deep
enough to give you a lay of the land; if I&rsquo;ve done my job, it should be easy
enough to Google for specific resources on any given topic (for example,
testing).</p>

<p>Now without further ado&hellip;</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been involved in conversations with a few Go developers who have
expressed frustration about Go&rsquo;s interfaces with respect to nil. It seems not
everyone understands that interfaces are a reference type (like a pointer), and
they can reference other reference types (i.e., pointers, maps, slices, etc).
Because all reference types have a nil (zero) value, an interface can be nil
or an interface can reference a nil pointer; people may fail to realize that
the nility of the interface is independent from the nility of the thing it
points to, and when we ask (for example) <code>if err != nil</code>, we&rsquo;re actually asking
<em>is the interface nil?</em>, not <em>is the value behind the interface nil?</em>. Here are
a few examples that will (<em>hopefully</em>) demonstrate this clearly:</p>

                    <p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m curious about the performance of different languages. At work, I
usually write Python, but I often find tasks that are inherently parallelizable
and could thus benefit from parallel execution. Unfortunately, Python is
notoriously difficult to parallelize<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:posts/benchmarking-go-and-python.htmla"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:posts/benchmarking-go-and-python.htmla">1</a></sup>. In one case, we needed to validate
that a table of values of a particular type could be convertible into a values
of a different type based on some known set of conversion rules. Since Go is a
great language for writing concurrent programs (and executing them in
parallel), I decided to compare a sequential Python implementation to
sequential and parallel Go implementations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve known about this blog post for a couple years, and I find myself frequently
referring people to it. It&rsquo;s written by a Google engineer who does a much better
job of articulating good architecture techniques than I could. A must-read for
any software developer: <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/08/by-miko-hevery-so-you-decided-to.html">Writing Testable Code by Misko Hevery</a></p>

<p>This next post is something I just came across, but it does a really good job
explaining why writing testable code is not just about validating your code&rsquo;s
functionality. Because it&rsquo;s something I run into a lot in dynamic languages like
Python or Qt/C++, I would also add that hacky workarounds (like Python&rsquo;s
<code>unittest.mock.patch()</code>) exist that let you technically validate your code
without actually writing what is considered to be well-designed, testable code.
